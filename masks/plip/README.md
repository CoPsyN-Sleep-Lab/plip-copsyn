The masks here were generated through various means, often times scripted.  It's possible that the names given may not match what you expect!
"Right" may actually be "Bilateral".  10mm masks are usually smaller than 10mm, not spherical, and contain holes.  
Regions may not be in the location you expect although I'm pretty sure nothing lands outside the MNI brain.
Always inspect the masks analyzed before trusting the name
Unfortunately this carries over to the biotype scripts also so collaborators may get confused
See Lea, Andrea, and Tali for more details how the masks were generated

For instance the "911981_Right_10mm_sgACC_Threat_4_26_n10" mask is actually bilateral.
